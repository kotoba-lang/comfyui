  "The full chain this ADR-2607131500 phase set out to prove end-to-end: a
  ComfyUI-API-format workflow, run through the REAL comfyui.exec topological
  executor, dispatching a node whose :fn does REAL tensor math (conv2d + relu
  + attention) via kotoba-lang/num — not a shape contract, not a proxy to
  Python. conv2d/attention's own arithmetic is already exhaustively hand-
  verified in num's own test suite (num.tensor-test); this test's job is the
  WIRING — node registry -> exec engine -> real :fn -> real compute — plus a
  sanity bound on the output (attention output is a convex combination of
  its V rows, so it must fall within [min(V) max(V)])."
