  "Pure SDXL txt2img node graphs for ComfyUI's **native** protocol.

  `comfyui.gateway` speaks the OpenAI-images shape and therefore needs a
  translating bridge in front of a real ComfyUI. That bridge is a middle layer
  that can be down while ComfyUI itself is up — observed 2026-07-31 on the
  murakumo fleet head node. This namespace removes it: the graph goes to
  /prompt as ComfyUI's own format.

  Pure: a request map in, a graph out. No HTTP, no env, so a graph can be
  asserted in a test without a GPU. `comfyui.native-client` moves the bytes.

  Node input names and defaults were read from a live server's /object_info
  (KSampler, EmptyLatentImage, SaveImage), not guessed."

  "Defaults a caller may override wholesale. A consumer that cares about style
  should state its own config rather than inherit these — the checkpoint in
  particular is a craft decision, not a technical one.

  A caller must NOT pass a model name that came out of its own data without
  checking it against the server: one caller's records carried
  `:sdxlModel \"gpt-4o-mini\"`, the LLM that wrote the prompt rather than an
  image model, which fails at the server with a confusing enum error."
