  "ADR-2607131500 Phase 1 — ONE node whose `:fn` is not host-bound-absent
  (unlike every node in `comfyui.nodes.diffusion`) but REAL: conv2d + relu +
  self-attention, dispatched through `kotoba-lang/num`'s verified CPU-backend
  tensor ops (num.tensor, ADR-2607131500). This is the honest minimal answer
  to 'reimplement ComfyUI's diffusion compute in Clojure' — proof the real
  `comfyui.exec` topological executor can run REAL tensor math for a node,
  not just validate shapes and proxy to Python (which is still what every
  node in `comfyui.nodes.diffusion` + `murakumo.infer.media` actually does
  for production image generation, and continues to do — this node does not
  replace that).

  NOT a real diffusion model: no trained weights, no safetensors loading, no
  real UNet architecture, no noise schedule, no sampler loop. 'ToyDiffusion
  Step' is ONE forward pass through a conv2d→relu→self-attention→reshape
  chain — the actual architectural SIGNATURE of a diffusion UNet block
  (spatial conv + attention), on a tiny single-channel 'image', with
  caller-supplied (not trained) weights. See ADR-2607131500 for the full,
  explicit scope fence.

  Optional dependency: unlike every other node pack in this repo, requiring
  this namespace pulls in `kotoba-lang/num` — NOT part of comfyui-clj's base
  deps (this repo's own deps.edn keeps `langchain` as the only third-party
  dep by design). A host registers this pack only if it brings `num` itself,
  exactly like `comfyui.gateway`'s JVM branch requires a host to bring
  http-kit/jsonista.

  ToyDiffusionStepMetal (`pack-metal`, added same ADR follow-up): the SAME
  conv2d→relu→attention shape, but `:fn` returns a JS Promise (via
  `num.tensor-async`'s conv2d-async/attention-async — the async twins that
  close num.tensor's own documented Deno-async gap) and must be run through
  `comfyui.exec/execute-async`, not the plain synchronous `execute`
  ToyDiffusionStep uses. Genuinely runs on real Metal when given a live
  `num.deno-gpu` backend NDArray — see `test/comfyui/nodes/toy_diffusion_metal_verify.cljs`.
  ToyDiffusionStep (CPU-sync) is UNCHANGED and still the node to reach for
  when a caller just wants `execute`, not `execute-async`.

  ToyDiffusionStepMC (`pack-mc`, 2026-07-13 \"raise the maturity\" loop): a
  MORE realistic UNet-block shape than `ToyDiffusionStep` — multi-channel
  conv2d (`num.tensor/conv2d-mc`) into multi-head self-attention
  (`num.tensor/multi-head-attention`), the actual channel/head-count axes a
  real diffusion UNet varies. `[C_out H W]` conv output is reinterpreted as
  `oh*ow` spatial TOKENS each embedded in `C_out` dims (the standard
  NCHW→spatial-token flattening: `reshape` [zero-copy] then `transpose`
  [real data move] — the reverse afterward restores `[C_out oh ow]`). CPU-
  sync only for now; no Metal-async twin yet (conv2d-mc/multi-head-attention
  don't have `num.tensor-async` counterparts — see that ns's own scope)."
